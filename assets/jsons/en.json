The constant pursuit of recognition and praise can cause us to start giving ourselves to others at the expense of ourselves Way - it is the absence of awareness of our own worth. Gradually, you will stop depending on the praise and recognition of others and you will begin to realize your worthStop doing things to please others, but start creating your life with activities that will write you.Too much clinging to the result causes stress, tension and the release of the hormone cortisol.  It prevents anything we do from bringing us joy.  Rather, focus your full attention on the activity you are doing.  Do it with joy and in flow.

How we use it is up to us.  Those who complain the most about the lack of time waste it the most. They don't realize how much time they waste on irrelevant tasks, clutter, fragmentation, or multitasking (working on many tasks at once). Lack of time = you are not clear about your priorities. Stop saying you dont have time.  Its not true, you have enough time. Say its not your priority. Realize that without a systematic plan and measurement of your growth, most of what you do, say, and spend your time during the day - is not important.  If the given activity is not related to your dreams, does not bring you benefit or joy, cross it out of your diary.  Embrace the time you have as your greatest asset. Consciously choose who you spend your time with and what you invest it in.  Realize whether the activity charges you, moves you forward or you are exhausted after it and you have to force yourself into it. HOW YOU LIVE YOUR DAYS IS HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE!  Stop putting off what is important to you. Those who know how to manage their time manage their life.  He who knows how to fill his time, fills his life.  He who has time is able to make all his dreams come true. Managing your time is important. Richard Branson",
